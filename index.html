		  <p id="eventdesc">In  celebration of the release of skatedeluxe x Nike SB NIght Pack, a nocturnal event took place last Saturday, November 23rd at Bobila DIY. 
			  Following the support last year, by the skatedeluxe skate shop, to the Bobila DIY Project to carry out the construction of the pyramid. 
			  This was the perfect occasion to meet and celebrate this Night Pack collection in style, since last year it was impossible to hold any event 
			  given the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic.
			  <br><br><br>
			  It was not a regular event since it was held, as previously mentioned, at night due to the different reflective elements of the capsule collection. 
			  People were summoned from 18:00 hrs. although different skaters were arriving throughout the day. By that time the spot was already overflowing with
			   people ready to enjoy and have fun. Pol Catena with a BS Tail Slide in the quarter pipe where the DJ was located and just behind the fence where part
			    of the different garments that make up the collection were presented, began to heat up the atmosphere. First a Skate Jam was held so that everyone 
				could participate, regardless of skate level, in this skateboarding celebration. Numerous stuff was given away among the skaters who were participating 
				and even among the public in the stands. Everyone seemed to be having a good time and enjoying themselves, with DJ Sam at the turntable playing the best 
				beats to the delight of the crowd.
				<br><br><br>
				Following the Skate Jam the Cash for Tricks took place. Once the sun went down at Bobila DIY, the spotlights were turned on and the skaters who participated 
				ripped up big time in each of the different sections where they were held: curb, wall ride and pyramid. The level of skateboarding shown was such a blast, 
				landing one trick after another nonstop that made the job of awarding cash to different skaters on the spot very difficult because it just wasn't going to 
				be enough. They did not leave a single inch of the different obstacles without ripping and especially an epic session took place when one after another 
				they did not stop landing tricks jumping over the pyramid, which was where the last Cash for Tricks was performed.</p>
